/*
As far as practicality goes, the current method of building lists leaves a lot to be desired. 
You can easily see that building long lists this way is impractical. 
A common way to alleviate this problem is to build a LinkedList that manages the Node objects. Youâ€™ll do just that!

                        Adding values to the list
    
    As mentioned before you are going to provide an interface to manage the NODE objects.
You will first take care of adding values. There are 3 ways to add values to a linked list, 
each having their own unique performance characteristics:

1. Push: Adds a value at the front of the list.
2. Append: Adds a value at the end of the list.
3. Insert(after:): Adds a value after a particular node of the list.

You will implement each off these in the next section and analyze their performance
characteristics.

                                PUSH OPERATIONS
    Adding a value at the front ofthe list isknown as a push operation. This is also
known as head-first insertion. The code for it's deliciously simple.
